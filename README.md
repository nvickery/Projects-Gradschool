# Project-Portfolio
A collection of various Python/Matlab/Simulink based projects I worked on while learning Robotics. All projects on this repository hold some applicability to robotics and make use of various libraries including numpy, scipy, scikit_learn, keras, Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox, and many other modules.
